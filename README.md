# A-top-Deep-Learning-models-for-Pneumonia-Detection

Pneumonia, a severe respiratory condition, remains a leading cause of mortality worldwide, particularly in children and the elderly. Early and accurate detection is crucial for effective treatment and patient outcomes. This paper presents an efficient deep learning approach for pneumonia detection using chest X-ray images. Leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs), our model is trained on a large, annotated dataset to automatically identify pneumonia with high precision. We employ various data augmentation techniques to enhance the model's generalization capability and address the issue of data imbalance.

In addition to our proposed model, we conduct a comprehensive comparison of five state-of-the-art deep learning models: VGG16, ResNet121, DenseNet121, ChexNet, and MobileNet. Each model is evaluated on the same dataset using metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and computational efficiency. The comparison reveals significant insights into the strengths and limitations of each model, providing a clear understanding of their applicability in different clinical scenarios.

The proposed approach and comparative analysis demonstrate superior performance in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. Additionally, our method significantly reduces the computational cost and inference time, making it feasible for deployment in real-time clinical settings. This study underscores the potential of deep learning in advancing medical diagnostics and highlights the importance of integrating AI-driven solutions in healthcare.
